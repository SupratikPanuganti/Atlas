# 🎯 Final Animation Fix Summary - All Errors Resolved

## ✅ **Root Cause Identified & Fixed**

### **Problem**:

- React Native Reanimated was still installed and causing Babel plugin errors
- Old `ProgressBar.tsx` file was still importing React Native Reanimated
- Metro bundler was trying to load worklets plugin that didn't exist

### **Solution Applied**:

1. ✅ **Completely removed React Native Reanimated**: `npm uninstall react-native-reanimated`
2. ✅ **Deleted old ProgressBar.tsx**: Removed file that was importing Reanimated
3. ✅ **Cleared Metro cache**: Used `npx expo start --clear` to remove cached dependencies
